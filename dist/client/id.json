At the same time, this is about easing resources data transparency and openness, and the transmission of those data from the business to the customer.",

What if our daily interactions with resources, our transactions, were contributing to make everyone's knowledge on those resources grow? <strong>Inventaire is an experiment to make a step in this direction</strong>, starting by using <strong><a href=\"http://wikidata.org/\" class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wikidata</a></strong> - the awesome public database gathering facts for Wikipedia - as a starting point to gather data on resources. All public data gathered in Inventaire will be published under an open licence.",
  "pitch_open_source": "Closed centralized systems grow dependency and lock-in the user in this system, while contributive, free and open knowledge needs trust to thrive. Trust comes from the possibility always opened to take what was built together and continue somewhere else, to explore new avenues or if the choices made here start to diverge from what the community expects. That's why <strong><a href=\"http://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/\" class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inventaire's code</a> is a Free/Open software published under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html\" class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AGPL3 licence</a></strong>. Today, the Inventaire experiment has a centralized technical architecture as decentralized architectures are hard to achieve: efforts are focused on bringing users value from open knowledge with as little pain as possible, but finding ways to overcome this centralization is part of the trip.",
